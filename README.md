# Home

App for accessing Home Assistant. And really, its just a webview :)

Settings will open:
- Upon first run (when no home assistant URL is saved)
- Whenever saved URL cannot be reached (no network, home assistant not running, ...)

I decided not to place a top bar with a settings-button, but instead make the webview fullscreen. This means you have to disable WiFi and run the app in order to bring up the configuration page whenever you want to change the home assistant URL.
